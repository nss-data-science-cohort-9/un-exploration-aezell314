    "When working with large datasets, it can sometimes pay off to be mindful of what data types you are using for each variable.\\\n",
    "a. Create a new column, Continent_Category by converting the Continent column to a category.\\\n",
    "b. Use the memory_usage method to compare the memory used by the original Continent column compared to the category version.\\\n",
    "c. You can also sometimes get speedups for groupby operations by using category datatypes. In Jupyter, if you want to estimate how long it takes to run a block of code, you can add the %%timeit magic to the top of a cell. Compare doing a groupby + aggregation on the original Continent column compared to the Continent_Category column.\\\n",
    "d. You can also sometimes save memory usage by adjusting the size that is stored for integer values. By default, the int64 type is used which can store values between –9223372036854775808 and 9223372036854775807. However, for the Year variable, we really don't need that large of a range. We could get by with a 16 bit integer, whose range is -32768 to 32768. Convert the Year column to int16 type and then compare the memory usage.\\\n",
    "e. Finally, you don't have to make these datatype changes after the data has been read in. Add some parameters to the read_csv call that imports the GDP data. Read in only the needed columns (not the Value Footnotes column). Also, read in the Country or Area column as a category type and the Year column as an int16 type."
